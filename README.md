Developed a machine learning-based system for early detection of diseases in pomegranate fruits.
Utilized image processing techniques to segment fruit images and identify suspicious lesions.
Employed GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) for extracting textural features from images.
Implemented a two-phase approach: training the model with labeled data and testing its accuracy on unseen samples.
Achieved improved accuracy in detecting common diseases such as bacterial blight and fruit rot. - Created a dataset consisting of 400 images, including 150 images of "fruit rot," 90 images of "scab," and 160 images of healthy fruits.
Utilized a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to categorize images into healthy or diseased classes.
Achieved an accuracy rate of 83% in disease detection, demonstrating the effectiveness of the machine learning model.
Developed a user-friendly web application for farmers to upload images and receive instant disease predictions.
Focused on enhancing the efficiency of disease detection methods to minimize economic losses for farmers.
Conducted extensive preprocessing steps, including image normalization and resizing, to prepare data for model training.
Employed deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to improve classification accuracy.
Integrated feature extraction methods to enhance the model's ability to differentiate between healthy and diseased fruits.
Contributed to the advancement of smart agriculture by providing a practical solution for disease management in pomegranate cultivation.
